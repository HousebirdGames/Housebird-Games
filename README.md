# Housebird Games

Welcome to Housebird Games, my project portfolio and blog. This repository serves as the foundation for [housebird.games](https://housebird.games), but please note that it doesn't include the backend.

The site is built with the [Birdhouse framework](https://github.com/HousebirdGames/birdhouse). To fully experience the project, it needs to be integrated with Birdhouse.
